# Hue-Remote App

This is a web-app utility to set your Philips Hue lightbulbs to specific colors at specific timestamps. WIP, currently supports one light at a time with variable color, timestamp, and transition time.

## Setup

Download or clone repository onto your disk. You'll need to fill in the values in .envtemplate with your own codes, all of which can be generated by sending requests to the Hue API (I used [this](https://gotoguy.blog/2020/05/21/remote-authentication-and-controlling-philips-hue-api-using-postman/) Postman tutorial).

You'll also need to install all the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn`, depending on your preferred package manager. After this, you should be all set to locally run the web-app with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
